- ‚ñ∫ Implementation of ETL Strategies and Predictive Analysis for Cost Control: Developed and implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and applied inferential statistical analysis to optimize the product cost sheet system.
 This led to improved control of raw material costs, packaging supplies, labor, and overhead costs, resulting in a more accurate calculation of the real net margin.
- ‚ñ∫ ‚ñ™ Optimization of Macros and Queries for Time Reduction: Improved the performance of macros and queries used for inventory valuation (Raw Materials, Work in Process, Finished Goods), reducing response times by 15% and 27%, respectively.
 This improvement enabled more agile processes and a significant increase in productivity when valuing inventories.
- ‚ñ∫‚ñ™ Optimization of the Overhead Cost System (Indirect Manufacturing Costs): Enhanced the calculation of overhead costs through mathematical modeling, which allowed for a more accurate allocation of indirect costs to the company's cost centers,
 resulting in a fairer and more efficient distribution of these costs.

- ‚ñ∫ Leadership in Lean Manufacturing and SMED: I coordinated the implementation of Lean Manufacturing methodology and the SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) technique,
 achieving a 30% increase in the efficiency of embroidery and ultrasound machines by reducing machine changeover times and optimizing production processes.
- ‚ñ∫ Automation and Improvement in Data Management: I led the automation of database management in the garment and quilting plant through Excel macros and Python,
 eliminating repetitive tasks and reducing data entry errors by 40%. Additionally, I improved data entry by 35%, increasing the reliability of the KPIs used for decision-making.
